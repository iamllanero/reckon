# To modify a transaction, add an entry with the transaction id as the key
# and the example values provided below. The transaction id can be found  in
# flatten.csv and txns.csv as the 'id' column.
#
# The example below shows an entry that appears as a receive transaction,
# however it is part of a sales transaction. We specify the correct transaction
# here and ignore the USDC send trasnaction in the entry below.

# Another common mistake may be if a transaction swap is missing the send
# token. In this case, you can create two entries with the same key. One
# to record the buy and the other to record the sell. The (fake) example
# below shows a transaction where the user swapped 100 ALD for xALD.
